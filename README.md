# GCP CI/CD Pipeline – Flask Application

This project was created as part of the **Multi Media Networking** course at my university.

The goal of the project is to set up a **CI/CD pipeline** for a simple, containerized **Flask application** using the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
The pipeline automatically builds, deploys, and updates the application in the cloud whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> The CI/CD pipeline and deployed services are **only temporarily active** and may be disabled at any time to prevent misuse or unnecessary cloud resource consumption.
